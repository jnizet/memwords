MemWords is developed in Java.
It uses [http://www.stripesframework.org/ Stripes] as its UI framework, combined with [http://www.opensymphony.com/sitemesh/ Sitemesh] for the page layout, and [http://jquery.com/ JQuery] as Javascript library. 

MemWords also uses a dependency injection framework: [http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ Guice]. Guice is integrated into Stripes using [http://code.google.com/p/stripes-guicer/ stripes-guicer].

The project is built using [http://ant.apache.org Ant].

Unit tests are developed with [http://junit.org/ JUnit] and [http://easymock.org/ EasyMock], and integration tests with [http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/ HtmlUnit].

The quality of the Java code is controlled by [http://pmd.sourceForge.net/ PMD], [http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ Checkstyle] and [http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/ FindBugs].

The quality of the JavaScript code is controlled by [http://www.jslint.com/ JSLint], integrated into the build process thanks to [http://code.google.com/p/jslint4java/ jslint4java].

Source code coverage is measured using [http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/ Cobertura].
